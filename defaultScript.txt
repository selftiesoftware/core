/* this is a WIP of a mock-up of our concept for what we call the "Internet of Digital Design" (IDD) .
    Please read through this quick intro:
NAVIGATION: pan and zoom with the mouse center wheel
DRAWING: Currently lines, text, and circles are supported
COMMENTING: anything within dash and * is ignored.
COMPILATION: real-time unless 'stop' is pressed
PRINTING: PDF (A4) currently scale 1:1 is supported
SAVING TO PNG: Right click and choose "save image as..."

#draw a line from (-80,80) to (80,80):
line -80 80 80 80

#draw a text with the text height 8, reading "10" (currently text can be only numbers, not characters:
text 0 -82 8 10

The sample script below shows how a for-loop is used:


for i <- -2 to 3 {
    for j <- -2 to 8 {
        line -90 j * 18 90 i * 27
    }
}
